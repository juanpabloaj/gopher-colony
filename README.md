I created this repository to test and compare LLMs.

The files REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, and PROMPT.md contain the information to use by the agents.

The main task is create a real-time website with Go and websockets. I chose it because, sometimes (until the current date, at least in my experience), it is not easy for the agent to identify different scenarios of concurrency that must be considered. The requeriments is splitted into phases to check the implementation step by step.

Check the branches to see the results.
